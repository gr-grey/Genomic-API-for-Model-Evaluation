#function to check for duplicate keys in the JSON file
def check_duplicates(json_file_path):
    """
    Parses a JSON file to detect and report any duplicate keys. If no duplicates
    are found, the JSON data is read into a variable.

    The aim of this function is to count each key's occurrences before
    fully loading the JSON into a dictionary, allowing it to identify
    duplicate keys in the JSON file.

    Args:
        json_file_path (str): The path to the JSON file to parse and check for duplicates.

    Returns:
        dict or None: Returns the parsed JSON data as a dictionary if no duplicates are found.
                      Otherwise, prints the duplicate keys and returns None.
